##DAY 1 ANDELA - PRIME NUMBER GENERATOR

This repo contains Python code that generates prime numbers from 0 to a given number n. It uses two functions, one that accepts input and then generates the prime number based on result from aother is_prime function

Various improvements are made to ensure the code performance is optimal.

Asymptotic analysis is later carried out on the program to measure the time space complexity.

There are also test cases provided
